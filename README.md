##Â Goliath National Bank

This application has been developed as a technical skill test for BeMobile. It is based on MVC architecture and includes dependencies both from SPM and CocoaPods.

Automatic string literals generated with SwiftGen. API data cached with CoreData Database. The UI has never been freezed, the user is forced to specify a name at first launch in order to provide a better user experience and let the app download the data for the first time.

Thank you for your time, any feedback would be really appreciated.
